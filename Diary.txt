03/10 - E&S: Two hour planning session. Decided on logistic regression algorithm, researched definitions and read articles: 
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logistic_regression
        https://codesachin.wordpress.com/2015/08/16/logistic-regression-for-dummies/
        
        Decided to write in Java. Emma created Github repository to easily collaborate, and for assignment correctors to easily see
        individual contributions.
        
        Discussed basic input/output, desired methods and classes for project. Sean suggested a very generic program that can take
        in a variety of data: including strings. Not just numbers as per the owls15.csv file. He also suggested good visualisation of
        the data, such as learning curves and ROC curves. 
        
        Together proposed three main classes should be working/computing class, GUI class and test class. Emma offered to spend some
        time that evening creating skelton classes and start writing the outline of some of the basic methods.
